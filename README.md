This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:
npm run dev

localhost:3000 will give you the webiste.


This is my first Next.js website. I will hopefully finish this project, this will mostly be done without any tutorial and just documents and some stackoverflow practices. AI will not be used for the sake of learning it the old fasioned way, just to give me some starting skills in webdevelopment.

Maybe I will try to stream this progress, but for starters it will be a closed learning session. With my long time since programming I will probably struggle with GIT to.
